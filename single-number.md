# Single Number

## Two Single Numbers

* Two passes
* 1st pass: find xor of all the numbers 
* figure out arbitrary bit that was set in the result of the xor
* separate numbers in two groups, one group with that bit set and the other not
* xor them separately and we get the two numbers that are single
